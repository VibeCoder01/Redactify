# Redactify

Redactify is a web application for redacting sensitive information from PDF documents. It is built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript** and styled using **Tailwind CSS** and components from [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). The project is configured for Firebase App Hosting.

## Features

- **PDF Upload** – drag and drop or select a PDF file to begin.
- **Manual redaction** – click and drag to highlight areas that should be redacted.
- **Smart suggestions** – optional suggestions for common sensitive terms (see `docs/blueprint.md`).
- **Undo, clear and reset** – manage redaction boxes before finalising the document.
- **Download options** – export either a _recoverable_ or _secure_ flattened PDF.
